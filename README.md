Hi, I'm Aaron Beier, a passionate software developer from Germany. ðŸ‘‹

My professional journey:
- Completed vocational training to become an electronics technician for information and telecommunications systems (Informations- und Telekommunikationssystemelektroniker)
- Currently pursuing additional vocational training to become an IT specialist for application development (Fachinformatiker fÃ¼r Anwendungsentwicklung)

While my passion lies in software development, particularly C#, I am also interested in IT hardware, especially server and computer assembly.  

![My skills: Windows, Linux, Bash, C#, .NET, Java, Markdown, Visual Studio](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=windows,linux,arch,bash,cs,dotnet,java,md,visualstudio)
